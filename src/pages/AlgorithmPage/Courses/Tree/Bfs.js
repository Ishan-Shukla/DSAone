        Breadth First Search
      </div>
      Breadth - First Traversal(or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth -
      First Traversal of a tree.The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may
      contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.To avoid processing
      a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.For simplicity, it
      is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
      <br />
      <br />
      For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2.
      When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is
      also an adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2
      will be processed again and it will become a non - terminating process.A
      Breadth - First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 3, 1.
